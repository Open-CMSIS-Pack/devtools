# Open-CMSIS-Pack Development Tools and Libraries

This repository contains components used to develop Open-CMSIS-Pack
command-line tools based on reusable libraries.

Files and directories in this tree follow a structure meant to:

- Make it easy to develop and maintain the components.
- Promote consistency throughout the repository.
- Make it easy to decide where in the tree new additions should be placed.

## Folders

### Github workflow

The [.github](./.github) directory contains the github workflow configurations for
continous integration environement.

### CMake Helpers

Open-CMSIS-pack uses cross-platform build environment `CMake`. The [./cmake](./cmake)
directory contains a list of `.cmake` files which are the reusable components used by
CMake configurations.

### Documentation

The [doc](./docs) directory contains all the documentation written using
Markdown and are documenting different steps and guidelines to used to develop
the tools and libraries.

### External Dependencies

The folder [external](./external) contains third party components
the tools and libraries depend on. These dependencies are pulled in as
submodules and remain unmodified.

### Library Components

Components not compiling into executable programs (i.e. static or dynamic
libraries) are kept in [libs](./libs) folder and are intended to be shared
between multiple components.

> **Note:** Each library directory contains a `test` sub-directory that holds
the source code to test the library.

    â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚xmltreeslim
    â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œCONTENT.md
```

### Scripts and Helpers

The [scripts](./scripts) folder stores helper script. The intent of this
directory is to store all future helper scripts.

### Test Data

The test data under [test](./test) directory is required for testing purposes
(i.e. not production code for release) and is intended to be shared by multiple
tests in this repository.

### Development Tools

Components compiling into one ore more executable programs (i.e. development
tools) are kept [tools](./tools) folder.

> **Note:** All tools contains tests respectively to validate their implementations.
