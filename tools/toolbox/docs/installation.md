## Installation

The [**CMSIS-Toolbox**](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/releases) is provided for Win64, Linux, and macOS in an archive file.
 > Note: The `cmsis-toolbox.sh` is provided for legacy reasons, but may be deprecated in future versions.

To setup the **CMSIS-Toolbox** on a local computer, install the content of the archive file to `<cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>`, for example to `/c/ctools`.

### Requirements

The CMSIS-Toolbox uses the CMake build system with a Ninja generator. The installation of these tools is required.

- [**CMake**](https://cmake.org/download) version 3.18.0 or higher.
> Note: For Win64, enable the install option *Add CMake to the system PATH*.
> 
- [**Ninja**](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) version 1.10.0 or higher.
> Note: [**Ninja**](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) may be copied to the `<cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/bin` directory.

### Toolchain Options

The CMSIS-Toolbox works with the following toolchains. Install one or more toolchains depending on your requirements.

- [**GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain**](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) version 10.2.1 or higher.

- [**Keil MDK**](http://www.keil.com/mdk5/install) version 5.36 or higher.

- [**ARM Compiler**](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/arm-compiler/downloads/version-6) version 6.16 or higher.

- [**IAR EW-Arm**](https://www.iar.com/products/architectures/arm/iar-embedded-workbench-for-arm/) is currently in alpha quality.

## Configuration

It is required to customize the installation for the actual setup of your development environment as described in the following.

### ./etc/setup/\*.cmake

The support of the various toolchains is defined by `*.cmake` files in the directory `<cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/etc/setup`.

> Note: The filenames reflect the available compiler versions on the host system.  There may be multiple files for each compiler to support different versions, for example `AC6.6.16.0.cmake` and `AC6.6.18.0.cmake`.

Each of these `*.cmake` files defines the path (`TOOLCHAIN_ROOT`) to the toolchain binaries, the file extension (`EXT`) of the executable binaries, and other compiler related parameters for the invocation. Edit the files to reflect the path as shown in the example (for `AC6`) below:

```txt
############### EDIT BELOW ###############
# Set base directory of toolchain
set(TOOLCHAIN_ROOT "C:/Keil_v5/ARM/ARMCLANG/bin")
set(EXT .exe)
```

### Setup Win64

For Windows use the **System Properties** dialog and add the following **Environment Variables**:

Variable                 | Value
:------------------------|:---------------
**CMSIS_PACK_ROOT**      | Path to the central CMSIS-Pack folder (i.e. C:\Keil_v5\ARM\PACK)
**CMSIS_COMPILER_ROOT**  | Path to the CMSIS-Toolbox 'etc' directory (i.e. C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ctools\etc)
**Path**                 | Add to the system path to the CMSIS-Toolbox 'bin' directory (i.e. C:\Keil_v5\ARM\ctools\bin)

>Note: At the Windows command prompt using `set` should shown the above environment variable settings.

### Setup Linux or Bash

The following instructions work on Linux or a Bash enviornment (such as Git Bash).

In file `<cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/etc/setup` the paths to the central pack directory (CMSIS_PACK_ROOT), the compiler definition files (CMSIS_COMPILER_ROOT), and the binaries (CMSIS_BUILD_ROOT) are defined.
This settings should reflect the configuration of your system. 

**Example:**
```txt
export CMSIS_PACK_ROOT=/c/open-cmsis/pack
export CMSIS_COMPILER_ROOT=/c/ctools/etc
export CMSIS_BUILD_ROOT=/c/ctools/bin
```

In a bash environment the following command configures the environment:
```txt
source <cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/etc/setup
```

### Setup MacOS

MacOS protects by default execution of files that are downloaded and/or not signed. As the CMSIS-Toolbox is currently no signed, it is required to execute the following commands after installation:

- Remove the flags that prevent execution for downloaded executables
```txt
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/bin/
```
  - Add execution permissions for all executables in ./bin
```txt
chmod +x <cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/bin/cbuildgen
chmod +x <cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir>/bin/cbuild
...
```

## Using VS Code

VS Code is an effective environment to create CMSIS-based projects.  As [**csolution**](../../projmgr/docs/Manual/Overview.md) files are in YAML format, it is recommended to install:

- [**YAML Language Support by Red Hat**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

To work with the **CMSIS-Toolbox** in VS Code use:

- **Terminal - New Terminal** to open a terminal window, on Win64 choose as profile `Command prompt`.

- In the **Terminal** window enter the following command:

## Get Started

To create a new [**csolution**](projmgr/docs/Manual/Overview.md) based CMSIS project in VS Code:

- Copy the `{{SolutionName}}.csolution.yml` and `{{ProjectName}}.cproject.yml` templates from the `<cmsis-toolbox-installation-dir/etc/` into your project directory and choose filenames at your discretion.

- Edit the YAML files to select a device, add files and components. The template files have references to the YAML schemas in the first comment `#yaml-language-server`.

- Use the Package Installer [**cpackget**](../../cpackget/docs/cpackget.md) to create a new pack repository, download and install packs.

- Use the Project Manager [**csolution**](../../projmgr/docs/Manual/Overview.md) to get information from the installed packs such as device names and component identifiers, to validate the solution and to generate the `*.CPRJ` files for compilation.

- Use the Build Manager [**cbuild**](../../buildmgr/docs/cbuild.md) to generate CMakeLists, invoking CMake to generate artifacts and compilation database for enabling Intellisense.

>Note: Keil MDK may be used to [*import*](https://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/uv4/uv4_ui_import.htm) and [*export*](https://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/uv4/uv4_ui_export.htm) project files in `*.CPRJ` format.
