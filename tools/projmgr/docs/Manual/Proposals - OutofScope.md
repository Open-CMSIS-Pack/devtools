# csolution: Proposals (on hold)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

This document is a collection of proposals that are currently on hold and will not get implemented for CMSIS-Toolbox 2.0.
The proposals in this document will be discussed and potentially progressed after release of CMSIS-Toolbox 2.0.

## ASM Specific nodes

In CMSIS-Toolbox 2.0 the `define:` and `add-path:` will be applied only to C and C++ source files.
For assembler files, `misc:` can be used to add sepcific controls

In a later version of the CMSIS-Toolbox, ASM specific controls may be added.
`define-asm:` only applies to assembly source files (new)
`add-path-asm:` only applies to assembly source files (new)

## Linker Script

In CMSIS-Toolbox 2.0 the [Linker Script Management](Linker-Script-Management.md) will be implemented.

In a later iteration of the tools it should be possible to generate the `regions_<device_or_board>.h` with a workflow that is similar to "CMSIS-Zone" or "DeviceTree".

## Resource Management (Proposal)  (out-of-scope)

The **csolution - CMSIS Project Manager**  integrates an extended version of the Project Zone functionality of
[CMSIS-Zone](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Zone/html/index.html) with this nodes:

- [`resources:`](#resources) imports resource files (in
  [CMSIS-Zone RZone format](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Zone/html/xml_rzone_pg.html) or a compatible yml
  format tbd) and allows to split or combine memory regions.
- [`phases:`](#phases) defines the execution phases may be used to assign a life-time to memory or peripheral resources
  in the project zones.
- [`project-zones:`](#project-zones) collect and configure the memory or peripheral resources that are available to
  individual projects. These zones are assigned to the [`projects:`](YML-Input-Format.md#projects) of a `*.csolution.yml` file.
- [`requires:`](#requires) allows to specify additional resources at the level of a `*.cproject.yml` or `*.clayer.yml`
  file that are added to the related zone of the project.

The **csolution - CMSIS Project Manager** generates for each project context (with build and/or target-type) a data file
(similar to the current [CMSIS FZone format](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Zone/html/GenDataModel.html), exact
format tbd could be also JSON) for post-processing with a template engine (Handlebars?).

### `resources:`

`resources:`                                   |              | Content
:----------------------------------------------|--------------|:------------------------------------
`- import:`                                    | **Required** | File/resource to be used.
`- split:`                                     |   Optional   | Split a resource/memory region.
`- combine:`                                   |   Optional   | Combine a resource/memory region.

#### `- import:`

`- import:`                                    |              | Content
:----------------------------------------------|--------------|:------------------------------------
`- import:` path_to_resource                   | **Required** | Path to the resource file.

#### `- split:`

Split a resource into subresources.

`- split:`                    |              | Content
:-----------------------------|--------------|:------------------------------------
`into:`                       | **Required** |
&nbsp;&nbsp; `- region:` name | **Required** | Name of the new resource.
&nbsp;&nbsp; `- size:` value  | **Required** | Size of the new resource.

#### `- combine`

Combine/merge resources into a new resource.

`- combine:` name             |              | Content
:-----------------------------|--------------|:------------------------------------
`from:`                       | **Required** |
&nbsp;&nbsp; `- region:` name | **Required** | Name of the resource to be combined.

**Example:**

Added to `*.csolution.yml` file

```yml
resources:
# depending on the device: and/or board: settings these resources may get added automatically
  - import: .\LPC55S69.rzone             # resource definitions of the device
  - import: .\MyEvalBoard.rzone          # add resource definitions of the Eval board

  - split: SRAM_NS                       # split a memory resource into two regions
    into:
    - region: DATA_NS
      size: 128k
    - region: DATA_BOOT
      size: 45k

  - combine: SRAM                        # combine two memory regions (contiguous, same permissions) 
    from:
      - region: SRAM1
      - region: SRAM2
```

> **Note:**
>
> Exact behavior for devices that have no RZone file is tbd. It could be that the memory resources are derived from device definitions

### `phases:`

**Example:**

Added to `*.csolution.yml` file

```yml
phases:    # define the life-time for resources in the project-zone definition
  - phase: Boot
  - phase: OTA
  - phase: Run
```

### `project-zones:`

**Example:**

Added to `*.csolution.yml` file

```yml
project-zones:   
  - zone: BootLoader
    requires:
    - memory: Code_Boot
      permission: rx, s
    - memory: Ram_Boot
      phase: Boot
      permission: rw, s
    - peripheral: UART1
    - peripheral: Watchdog
      phase: Boot      # only for phase Boot

  - zone: Application
    - memory: *        # all remaining memory
      permission: ns   # with permission ns
      phase: ~Boot     # for every phase except Boot

projects:
  - project: ./bootloader/Bootloader.cproject.yml           # relative path
    zone: Bootloader

  - project: ./application/MyApp1.yml                       # Application 1
    zone: Application

  - project: ./application/MyApp2.yml                       # relative path
    zone: Application
```

#### `requires:`

##### `- memory:`

##### `- peripheral:`

Added to `*.cproject.yml` or `*.clayer.yml` file

```yml
requires:
 - memory: Ram2
   permission: rx, s
 - peripheral: SPI2
   permission: ns, p
```

## Directory Control

### `rte-dirs:`

**(Proposal)**  Out-of-scope (review if this is really required)

The default RTE directory structure can be modified with [`rte-dirs:`](YML-Input-Format.md#rte-dirs).
This list node allows to specify for each software component `Cclass` the directory that should be used to partly share a common configuration across a `project:` or `layer:`.

The `rte-dirs:` list allows to control the location of configuration files for each [component `Cclass`](YML-Input-Format.md#component-name-conventions).  A list of `Cclass` names can be assigned to specific directories that store the related configuration files.

**Example:**

```yml
  rte-dirs:
    - Board_Support: ..\common\RTE\Board
    - CMSIS Driver:  ..\common\RTE\CMSIS_Driver
    - Device:        ..\common\RTE\Device\Core1
    - Compiler:      ..\RTE\Compiler\Debug
      for-context:      .Debug
```

- With [RTE directory settings](./YML-Input-Format.md#rte-dirs) that are specific to software component `Cclass` names it is possible partly share a common configuration across layers.

## CMSIS-Zone Integration

Suggest to split this into two sections:

- `resources:` to define the execution phases, memory regions and region splits, and peripherals. This section would be
  in the `csolution.yml` file.
- `requirements:` to define project requirements - effectively the partitioning of a system. It should be possible to
  assign to the application all remaining resources.

Add to the project the possibility to specify . The issue might be that the project files become overwhelming,
alternative is to keep partitioning in separate files.

```yml
resources:
  phases:    # define the life-time of a resource definition
    - phase: Boot
    - phase: OTA
    - phase: Run

  memories:              # specifies the required memory
    - split: SRAM_NS
      into:
      - region: DATA_NS
        size: 128k
        permission: n
      - region: DATA_BOOT
        phase: Boot      # region life-time (should allow to specify multiple phases)
        size: 128k
    
  peripherals:           # specifies the required peripherals
    - peripheral: I2C0
      permission: rw, s
```
