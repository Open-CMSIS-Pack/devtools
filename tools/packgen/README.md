# Pack Generation Tool

The utility `packgen` assists the generation of a CMSIS-Pack from CMakeLists
according to the standard
[format](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/develop/Pack/html/packFormat.html)
by reading a manifest YAML file with metadata and running the CMake generation
step to retrieve CMake targets build information, namely source files, include
paths and defines. It distributed as part of
the [CMSIS-Toolbox](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

## Requirements

- CMake: <https://cmake.org/>
- Ninja: <https://ninja-build.org/>

 > **NOTE:**  Make sure the CMake project has been previously configured and
 dependencies have been installed. It is a requirement to be able to
 successfully run the CMake generation step in the current environment.

For validating and compressing pack files, the `packchk` and `7-zip` utilities
shall be in the `PATH` system environment variable:

- [packchk](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/releases/tag/tools%2Fpackchk%2F1.4.1)
- [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

## Usage

```bash
 packgen [-V] [--version] [-h] [--help]
          [OPTIONS...] manifest.yml

 packgen options:
  -s, --source arg   Source root folder
  -o, --output arg   Output folder
  -i, --include arg  PDSC file(s) for external dependency check
  -r, --regenerate   Regenerate CMake targets
  -v, --verbose      Verbose mode
  -c, --nocheck      Skip pack check
  -z, --nozip        Skip *.pack file creation
  -h, --help         Print usage
  -V, --version      Print version
```

## Quick Start

The example
[CMakeTestProject](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools/packgen/test/data/CMakeTestProject)
provides an input
[manifest.yml](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools/packgen/test/data/CMakeTestProject/manifest.yml)
describing components and their inter-dependencies to be generated from the
[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools/packgen/test/data/CMakeTestProject/CMakeLists.txt).

The demonstration pack can be generated by executing the `packgen` tool in the example directory:

```bash
packgen manifest.yml -o OutputFolder
```

The generated pack files will be stored in the `OutputFolder` folder. The generated PDSC file should be identical to
[ARM.TestPack.pdsc](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools/packgen/test/data/CMakeTestProject/ARM.TestPack.pdsc).

## How it Works

The contents of a `component` are retrieved from the input manifest file and
from the CMake targets associated with it. If several CMake targets are listed,
the build information (source files, include paths and defines) will be merged.
The build information of other components or CMake targets listed as
`dependencies` will be filtered out.

External dependencies of a component can be added to the `conditions` list.
When an internal component is listed as dependency, a `require` condition is
automatically inserted. For checking the correctness of external dependencies
the path of external PDSC files (absolute or relative to the working directory)
can be specified with the command line option `--include`.

Files that are not among the build information such as config files can still
join a component by adding them to the `files` list.

After changing CMakeLists and/or other included CMake files, use the tool
option `--regenerate` to rerun the CMake generation step. When changing only
the input YAML file there is no need to regenerate CMake targets.

Multiple sets of CMake options are supported and shall be inserted in the
manifest file in the top level `build` mapping. The set(s) of options to be
considered in the generation of a given component shall be inserted in the
`build` field under the `components` mapping, while the `operation` to be
applied to them can be chosen as `intersection` or `difference`.

The `manifest.yml` file shall be placed alongside the entry point `CMakeLists.txt`.
The command line option `--source` shall be used to indicate the root (top-level)
source folder when the `CMakeLists.txt` and `manifest.yml` are not located at the
root folder. Paths inside the `manifest.yml` file shall be relative to the root folder.

The contents of include paths to be recursively copied into the pack can be
filtered by setting allowed file extensions in the `extensions` tag, the
default are `.h` and `.hpp`. These extensions are also used for handling file
categories of source files coming from CMake targets.

## Hints for Generating Packs

When starting the process of generating a new pack, the following workflow is recommended:

1. In the project's root folder side by side with the `CMakeLists.txt` create
   an input `YAML` file with the minimal required fields, for instance:

   ```yml
   build:
     - name: "build1"
       options: "cmake -G Ninja"

   packs:
     - name: "TestPack"
       description: "TestPack description"
       vendor: "ARM"
       license: "LICENSE"
       url: "http://arm.com/"
       releases:
         - version: "1.0.0"
           date: "2021-08-10"
           description: "Initial release"
   ```

1. Run `packgen` in verbose mode to obtain a list of CMake targets:

   ```bash
   packgen manifest.yml -o OutputFolder -v -c -z >log.txt
   ```

   In the example's case the following information will be printed:

   **`log.txt`**

   ```yml
   TARGET: lib1
   BUILD: build1
   src: lib1/src/lib1.cpp
   inc: lib1/inc

   TARGET: lib2
   BUILD: build1
   src: lib2/src/lib2.cpp
   inc: lib2/inc
   inc: lib3/inc
   inc: lib4/inc
   dep: lib3
   dep: lib4

   TARGET: lib3
   BUILD: build1
   src: lib3/src/lib3.cpp
   inc: lib3/inc

   TARGET: lib4
   BUILD: build1
   src: lib4/src/lib4.cpp
   inc: lib4/inc

   TARGET: lib5
   BUILD: build1
   src: lib5/src/lib5.cpp
   inc: lib5/inc
   ```

1. Describe the `components` to be generated by assigning targets to be exposed
   or filtered out, respectively in the components `target` or `dependencies`
   fields.

   In the example below the content of the generated component3 is merged from `lib4` and `lib5`:

   **`manifest.yml`**

   ```yml
     components:
       - name: component3
         target: [lib4, lib5]
         attributes: {Cclass: "Class3", Cgroup: "Group3", Csub: "Subgroup3", Cversion: "3.3.3"}
         description: "Component3"
   ```

   **`ARM.TestPack.pdsc`**

   ```xml
       <component Cclass="Class3" Cgroup="Group3" Csub="Subgroup3" Cversion="3.3.3">
         <description>Component3</description>
         <files>
           <file category="source" name="lib4/src/lib4.cpp"/>
           <file category="source" name="lib5/src/lib5.cpp"/>
           <file category="include" name="lib4/inc/"/>
           <file category="include" name="lib5/inc/"/>
         </files>
       </component>
   ```

## Multiple Sets of CMake Options

The example
[CMakeTestMultipleBuilds](./test/data/CMakeTestMultipleBuilds) has a
[CMakeLists.txt](./test/data/CMakeTestMultipleBuilds/CMakeLists.txt) producing a library with different sources and
include paths depending on the `DEVICE` option that can assume the values `DEV1`, `DEV2` or `DEV3`:

### CMakeLists.txt

  ```cmake
  if(DEVICE STREQUAL "DEV1")
    add_library(lib STATIC src/core.cpp
                           src/dev1.cpp)
    target_include_directories(lib PUBLIC inc
                                          inc1)
  elseif(DEVICE STREQUAL "DEV2")
    add_library(lib STATIC src/core.cpp
                           src/dev2.cpp)
    target_include_directories(lib PUBLIC inc
                                          inc2)
  elseif(DEVICE STREQUAL "DEV3")
    add_library(lib STATIC src/core.cpp
                           src/dev3.cpp)
    target_include_directories(lib PUBLIC inc
                                          inc3)
  endif()
  ```

  It means the CMake generation step has to be executed several times to cover
  all the possible results. To instruct the tool to run all the configurations,
  the [manifest.yml](./test/data/CMakeTestMultipleBuilds/manifest.yml)
  has the following build options mapping:

### manifest.yml

  ```yml
  build:
    - name: build-dev1
      options: "cmake -G Ninja -DDEVICE=DEV1"
    - name: build-dev2
      options: "cmake -G Ninja -DDEVICE=DEV2"
    - name: build-dev3
      options: "cmake -G Ninja -DDEVICE=DEV3"
  ```

  The description of every component indicates the sets of `build` options that will be associated and which
  `operation` will be applied to them, `intersection` or `difference`. Note in case of `difference` the order of sets
  is important:

### manifest.yml (continued)

  ```yml
  components:
    - name: core
      build: ["build-dev1", "build-dev2", "build-dev3"]
      operation: intersection

    - name: device1
      build: ["build-dev1", "build-dev2", "build-dev3"]
      operation: difference

    - name: device2
      build: ["build-dev2", "build-dev1", "build-dev3"]
      operation: difference

    - name: device3
      build: ["build-dev3", "build-dev1", "build-dev2"]
      operation: difference
  ```

Run `packgen` in verbose mode to print a list of CMake targets and the of generated components:

```bash
packgen manifest.yml -o OutputFolder -v -c -z > log.txt
```

The `core` component with common elements is generated by using the
`intersection` operation, while each other `device` component is created
with the `difference` operation:

### log.txt

  ```yml
  TARGET: lib
  BUILD: build-dev1
  src: src/core.cpp
  src: src/dev1.cpp
  inc: inc
  inc: inc1

  TARGET: lib
  BUILD: build-dev2
  src: src/core.cpp
  src: src/dev2.cpp
  inc: inc
  inc: inc2

  TARGET: lib
  BUILD: build-dev3
  src: src/core.cpp
  src: src/dev3.cpp
  inc: inc
  inc: inc3

  COMPONENT: core
  src: src/core.cpp
  inc: inc

  COMPONENT: device1
  src: src/dev1.cpp
  inc: inc1

  COMPONENT: device2
  src: src/dev2.cpp
  inc: inc2

  COMPONENT: device3
  src: src/dev3.cpp
  inc: inc3
  ```
