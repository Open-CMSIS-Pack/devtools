the predefined test inputs required to run the tests. All future
test input extensions should be placed under this directory.

## Integration Tests

[integtests](./integtests) directory contains all the sources containing
integration tests and compiles into an executable. The tests make use of test
input SVD files from [test](./test/data/) directory containing the
example SVD.

## Unit Tests

compiles into an executable. These unit tests uses **gtest** as a test framework.
